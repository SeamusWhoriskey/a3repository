/**
 * A MinMaxAI is a controller that uses the minimax algorithm to select the next
 * move.  The minimax algorithm searches for the best possible next move, under
 * the assumption that your opponent will also always select the best possible
 * move.
 *
 * <p>The minimax algorithm assigns a score to each possible game configuration
 * g.  The score is assigned recursively as follows: if the game g is over and
 * the player has won, then the score is infinity.  If the game g is over and
 * the player has lost, then the score is negative infinity.  If the game is a
 * draw, then the score is 0.
 * 
 * <p>If the game is not over, then there are many possible moves that could be
 * made; each of these leads to a new game configuration g'.  We can
 * recursively find the score for each of these configurations.
 * 
 * <p>If it is the player's turn, then they will choose the action that
 * maximizes their score, so the score for g is the maximum of all the scores
 * of the g's.  However, if it is the opponent's turn, then the opponent will
 * try to minimize the score for the player, so the score for g is the
 * <em>minimum</em> of all of the scores of the g'.
 * 
 * <p>You can think of the game as defining a tree, where each node in the tree
 * represents a game configuration, and the children of g are all of the g'
 * reachable from g by taking a turn.  The minimax algorithm is then a
 * particular traversal of this tree.
 * 
 * <p>In practice, game trees can become very large, so we apply a few
 * strategies to narrow the set of paths that we search.  First, we can decide
 * to only consider certain kinds of moves.  For five-in-a-row, there are
 * typically at least 70 moves available at each step; but it's (usually) not
 * sensible to go on the opposite side of the board from where all of the other
 * pieces are; by restricting our search to only part of the board, we can
 * reduce the space considerably.
 * 
 * <p>A second strategy is that we can look only a few moves ahead instead of
 * planning all the way to the end of the game.  This requires us to be able to
 * estimate how "good" a given board looks for a player.
 * 
 * <p>This class implements the minimax algorithm with support for these two
 * strategies for reducing the search space.  The abstract method {@link
 * #moves(Board)} is used to list all of the moves that the AI is willing to
 * consider, while the abstract method {@link #estimate(Board)} returns
 * the estimation of how good the board is for the given player.
